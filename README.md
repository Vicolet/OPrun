# OPrun

## Introduction
OPrun is a localhost mutiplayer calculation solver game in the console. the goal is to solve as many calculations as possible within a given time to earn points.
The player with most points at the end wins
There can be a total of 20 players connected at the same time.

## How to play
### Game flow
In order to connect to the server, the clients must be launched before the server. If the client is launched after the server then it must wait for the next round to join the game.
The server lets a bit of time for the clients to connect and then starts the game. The clients receive a calculation and must solve it as fast as possible to earn a point. A bad answer doesn't have any effect, you just have to try again. After a given time, the server stops the game and the leaderboard is displayed for each client. The player with the most points at the end of the round wins. \
After the leaderboard are displayed, the server listens for connections again and accepts all the new players for a total of 20 players connected to the same game.

### Prerequisites
#### Java Development Kit (JDK) 11 or higher
Download and install at this address: \
https://www.oracle.com/ch-de/java/technologies/javase/jdk11-archive-downloads.html \
\
Verify installation:
```bash 
java -version
```

#### Docker
Download and install at this address: \
https://docs.docker.com/engine/ \
\
Verify installation:
```bash
docker --version
```

### Set up build
#### Docker network
Use this command to create a network so the containers can communicate with each others:
ATTENTION A METTRE A JOUR. LE RESEAU 127.0.0.0 NE SEMBLE PAS ETRE COMPATIBLE DOCKER
AUSSI NOTRE MULTICAST NE FONCTIONNE PAS SUR CE SOUS RESEAU
```bash
docker network create \
  --driver bridge \
  --subnet=127.0.0.0/24 \
  game-network
```
#### Docker image
With the existing Dockerfile in the project build the image with the following command:
(mvn clean package -DskipTests) TEST
```bash
docker build -t oprun -f Dockerfile .
```

### Set up run
Use the following command to first run the client:\
Note: be sure to change the interface to suit your configuration. You can check your working interfaces with following command:
```bash
netsh interface show interface
```
And then run the client with the correct interface:\
Note: if you use multiple clients, make sure to also change the --name for each client.
A MODIFIER SELON L IP
```bash
docker run --rm -it \
  --name game-client-1 \
  --network game-network \
  oprun client --ip 127.0.0.1 --interface <interface>
```
Once all the needed clients have been launched, you can then run the server:
```bash
docker run --rm -it \
  --name game-server \
  --network game-network \
  oprun server
```
The game will launch and the clients will receive their first calculation.

### Example
After launching a client:
```code
Launching in client mode...
Waiting for server broadcasts
```
And then the server:
```code
Broadcast sent
Server listening on port 42069
[Serveur] Nouveau client connect√© depuis 127.0.0.1:44018
```
The client will display:
```code
Launching in client mode...
Waiting for server broadcasts
Connecting to server via TCP...
joined game as xX_EuclidSn1p3r_Xx
game started! Solve the calculations.
```
After a minute, the server launches the game and client will display its first calculation:
```code
Solve: 16+13*5-27
Your answer:
```
And finally after the given time the timer is stopped and the leaderboard is displayed:
```code
Leaderboard: <xX_EuclidSn1p3r_Xx><2>
```
All the clients disconnect, and wait for the server to start a new round. This allows new players to join the game.
